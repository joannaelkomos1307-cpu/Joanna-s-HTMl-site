	<p>Plato’s allegory of the cave describes people imprisoned who mistake their shadows for what's real, never truly realizing that the things they view are just projections created by angles and light. In many ways today, modern photography puts us in the same concept. Photopragphs can feel like they reflect the word, yet they are somehow changed by technology, settings, and the human choices made during editing that we now believe are raw and true. Concepts such as ISO and DPI show us that these images, such as Plato's shadows, are only interpretations of what humans believe the truth is, rather than the truth itself. 

	ISO in photography controls a camera’s sensitivity and reactivity to light. A low ISO is used to produce a clean and detailed image while a high ISO can produce a grainy picture. This can parallel the cave prisoner’s incompetence and reliance on the poor lighting that shape their perception because when light is scarce, prisoners compensate at a cost. The resulting image becomes noisy and distorted, not because the outside world itself has changed, but because the means of perception have changed. High ISO noise can block better detail which reflects the firelight in Plato’s cave that can blur the perception of the shadows. In both of these incidents, the light being limited changes the bigger picture. 

	DPI, aka dots per inch, can affect how much detail the image holds when it’s displayed anywhere. A low DPI can be fine at first, but the closer you get it reveals pixels and loss of clarity. This mirrors the prisoner’s inability to accept the shadows as their true reality. Without this ability to examine a closer low quality. Here, Plato’s point is that understanding things from a different perspective, much like increasing the DPI, is more nuanced. 

	Overall, photography raises multiple questions about the true raw and intentions of its creation. Even a “high-qaulity” image can be changed and create a new perspective due to angles, editing, or focus. Plato’s cave isn’t about poor perspective, it’s about deception normalized by comfort. A sharp photograph can still be a “shadow” when it lacks context or is edited to promote a false perspective. This ultimately makes it an illusion.

	In the digital age, saturated with images, Plato’s cave can feel the most relevant today because of the screens, algorithms, and things viewers see on the daily. Only through constructive criticism on photography can viewers step outside this mindset and recognize images can be created to form opinions rather than the truth.

	In the end, Plato’s messages push people to question appearances and find the true meaning behind everything, little or big. Photography, with its many editable options, shows how reality can be altered to anyone’s liking. The clearer the mage is, the more convincing it can become. But viewers must learn to question everything they see in photography and real life. In doing this, photography becomes a weapon against these “shadows” and a reminder that truth lies anywhere.
